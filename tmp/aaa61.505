If such relocation will delay Tenant's proposed opening date, then the Fixturing Period will be extended the lesser of: (i) the number of days required for making revisions to the plans and specifications for Tenant's leasehold improvements, or (ii) sixty (60) days. If Tenant refuses to relocate, then Tenant shall notify Landlord of such refusal within fifteen (15) days after Tenant is notified by Landlord of the location of the Relocation Space and Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Tenant, and neither party shall have any further liability to the other.</p>

Tenant shall deliver possession of the Premises to Landlord, within fifteen (15) days after the date Tenant opens for business in the Relocation Space, in the condition required pursuant to this Lease and subject to all charges which are due and owing or which shall accrue up to such date (which charges shall be paid to Landlord within thirty (30) days of such date). From and after the date Tenant takes possession of the Relocation Space, any and all references in this Lease to the Premises shall be deemed to be references to the Relocation Space.</p>

<p id="184"> Section 2.2. Term.</p>

<p id="185"> (a) The term of this Lease (the "Term") shall be for a period commencing on the date (the "Commencement Date") which is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Fixturing Period, or (ii) the date on which Tenant opens the Premises for business, and expiring at 11:59 p.m. local time on the day before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Commencement Date, unless extended or sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof (the "Expiration Date"). "Lease Year" means the twelve (12) month period beginning on the first day of the month immediately following the Commencement Date and terminating on the same day of the succeeding year, and on the same day of each year thereafter during the Term. The period of time, if any, between the Commencement Date and the first day of the month immediately following the Commencement Date shall be considered to be a part of the first Lease Year.</p>

<p id="186"> (b) Provided Tenant is not then in default hereof beyond any applicable notice and cure periods, Tenant shall have the option to extend the Term for two (2) additional periods of five (5) Lease Years each (each an "Option Period"). Said options shall be exercised, if at all, by written notice to Landlord at least twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the then-current Term. All terms and conditions contained herein shall apply during the Option Periods. If Tenant does not exercise the foregoing options to renew this Lease within the required time periods, then such options shall become null and void and be of no further force or effect.</p>

<p id="187"> Section 2.3. Opening. Subject to Section 2.2 hereof, Tenant covenants and agrees to complete its construction within the Premises in accordance with the provisions of this Lease, and to open for business with the public as the Permitted Use not later than sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Fixturing Period provided, however, Landlord shall have the right to delay Tenant's store opening for sixty (60) days upon written notice to Tenant given at least sixty (60) days prior to Tenant's scheduled store opening date.</p>

<p id="188"> Section 2.4. Late Opening. If Tenant fails to open for business with the public upon the Commencement Date, then in order to compensate Landlord for its loss, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent (as defined in Section 3.3 below), over and above the Minimum Rent and all other charges to be paid by Tenant to Landlord, a sum equal to $500.00 per day for each day after the Commencement Date that Tenant failed to open for business. This remedy shall be in addition to any and all other remedies provided for in this Lease in the event of such failure to open.</p>

<p id="189"> Section 2.5. Landlord's Leasing Covenant So long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease and is continuously operating in the Premises pursuant to the terms of this Lease (excluding temporary closings due to remodeling, renovations and condemnation) for Tenant's Permitted Use, Landlord agrees that from and after the date of full execution of this Lease through the Lease Term, it will not knowingly and intentionally enter into a lease (other than the Selective Tenants as defined herein) for the primary use of the retail operation of a nail salon (the "Restricted Use"). If Landlord violates the foregoing covenant, then SO long as Tenant is operating at the Premises, Tenant shall have the right, upon thirty (30) days written notice to Landlord, to pay, in lieu of Minimum Rent, seventy-five percent (75%) of the applicable rent payable hereunder. In the event Landlord violates such covenant, upon the cessation of the operation of the Restricted Use in the Shopping Center by such tenant(s) (other than the operation of same by Tenant or any Selective Tenants), Tenant shall</p>

<HR pn=12>


<p id="190"> immediately return to paying full Fixed Minimum Rent and Additional Rent as required under this Lease. For purposes of this Section 2.5, "Selective Tenants" shall mean (i) any tenant under a lease signed prior to the date of this Lease, (ii) any tenant whose lease permits the assignment thereof or the subletting of the premises demised thereby to operate for the Restricted Use, or (iii) any tenant occupying at least 10,000 square feet of gross leasable area within the Shopping Center. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.5 to the contrary, any leases or letters of intent that Landlord enters into during a period of time in which Tenant fails to operate its business at the Premises on an ongoing basis (excluding temporary closings due to remodeling, renovations and condemnation) shall not be subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 2.5.</p>

<p id="191"> This covenant is not an "exclusive" but rather a personal covenant between Landlord and Tenant and this shall not restrict any tenant from changing its use or subleasing its premises or assigning its lease to a party that will operate for the Restricted Use, nor will such covenant prohibit Landlord from entering into a lease containing an "open" use clause or other use clause not restricting a tenant's use (i.e. a provision permitting any use or any lawful use or words of similar import). Moreover, this provision shall not restrict Landlord from leasing space to a tenant which operates for the Restricted Use provided such sale is not such tenant's primary use. Tenant's remedies upon an alleged violation are limited to those enumerated in this Section 2.5.</p>

<p id="193"> RENT</p>

<p id="194"> Section 3.1. Minimum Rent. During the entire Term, Tenant shall pay annual minimum rental ("Minimum Rent") for the Premises in the amount set forth in Paragraph (3) of the Data Sheet, which sum shall be payable by Tenant in equal consecutive monthly installments in the amount set forth in the Data Sheet, on or before the first day of each month, in advance. The Minimum Rent and each of the monthly installments of rent called for hereunder shall be payable to Landlord, without demand, deduction, set-off or counterclaim. The first installment of Minimum Rent shall be paid in advance on the Commencement Date. If the Commencement Date occurs on a day other than the first day of a month, the first installment of Minimum Rent shall be prorated at a daily rate based on the number of days in such month.</p>

<p id="195"> Section 3.2. Percentage Rent.</p>

<p id="196"> (a) Tenant has no obligation to pay percentage rent. "Gross Sales" means the total price charged for all goods, merchandise, tickets, trade-ins, beverages and food sold, leased or licensed, and all services or other operations or items sold or rendered at, in, on, or from the Premises by or on account of Tenant or any sublessee, assignee, licensee or concessionaire of Tenant, for cash or on a charge, credit, or time basis or otherwise, including all orders for merchandise taken from or filled at or from the Premises, including all deposits not refunded to customers. The entire amount of the sale price shall be included in Gross Sales at such time as (i) the transaction is initially reflected in the books or records of Tenant or any person or entity operating in the Premises, or (ii) Tenant or such other entity receives all or any portion of the sales price, or (iii) the applicable goods or services are delivered to the customer, whichever first occurs. Gross Sales shall exclude (1) proceeds from any sales tax; (2) gross receipts tax or similar tax which are separately stated and in addition to the purchase price; (3) refunds to customers for merchandise purchased at the Premises and returned or exchanged; (4) sales of Tenant's fixtures and equipment not in the ordinary course of Tenant's business; (5) discounted sales to employees of Tenant (not to exceed two percent (2%) of Gross Sales); and (6) catalog sales and internet sales, except that sales of merchandise ordered from a catalog or over the internet shall be included in Gross Sales if the merchandise ordered from such catalog or internet sale is delivered and/or filled at the Premises and payment is made to the Premises; and, provided further that, the return of any merchandise to the Premises purchased through a catalog or the internet shall not be a deduction from Gross Sales.</p>

<p id="197"> (b) Within sixty (60) days following the end of each calendar year of the Term, Tenant shall submit to Landlord an accurate statement of Gross Sales certified by Tenant for such calendar year.</p>

Such books and records shall be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices and shall be retained by Tenant for a period of not less than three (3) years following the end of the Lease Year to which they have reference. Upon not less than ten (10) business days' prior written notice, Landlord and/or Landlord's auditor shall have the right to inspect and/or to audit the records of Tenant relating to Gross Sales.</p>

<p id="199"> Section 3.3. Payments By Tenant. Unless otherwise stated, all sums of money or charges of any kind or nature, in addition to Minimum Rent, payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to this Lease or the exhibits attached hereto are defined as "Additional Rent" and are due thirty (30) days after the rendering of an invoice therefor, without any deductions, set-offs or counterclaims, and failure to pay such sums of money or charges shall carry the same consequences as Tenant's failure to pay Minimum Rent. All payments shall be payable in United States funds, at the address indicated on the Data Sheet (unless otherwise specified by written notice from Landlord to Tenant). No payment by Tenant of a lesser amount than the correct rent shall be deemed to be other than a payment on account, and no endorsement or statement on any check or other communication accompanying a check shall be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check as partial payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance owed by Tenant or to pursue against Tenant any additional remedies available under this Lease or provided at law or in equity. The obligations of Tenant to pay Minimum Rent and Additional Rent that have accrued as of the date of expiration or sooner termination of the Term shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. The term "rent" as used in this Lese shall be deemed to be and to mean all sums of every nature required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease, whether to Landlord or to others.</p>

<p id="200"> Section 3.4. Late Charge. If any rent or other sums are not received on or before the date the same are due, Tenant shall immediately pay, as Additional Rent, (i) a service charge equal to five percent (5%) of the amount of such overdue payment for the purpose of defraying Landlord's administrative expenses relative to handling such overdue payment plus (ii) Interest (as defined in Section 21.12), which Interest shall accrue beginning on the date the payment was originally due and payable.</p>

<p id="201"> Section 3.5. Security Deposit. Tenant shall deposit with Landlord a security deposit in the amount set forth in Paragraph (12) of the Data Sheet (the "Security Deposit") upon execution of this Lease. If Tenant fails to make such deposit, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Tenant given prior to the delivery of the Security Deposit, and neither party shall have any further liability to the other. The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord without interest as security for the performance by Tenant of Tenant's covenants and obligations under this Lease, it being expressly understood that the Security Deposit may be commingled with Landlord's other funds and is not an advance payment of Rent or a measure of or limit to Landlord's damages in case of default by Tenant. Upon the occurrence of any event of default by Tenant that remains uncured beyond the applicable notice and cure period provided in this Lease, Landlord may, from time to time, without prejudice to any other remedy provided herein or provided by law, use such fund to the extent necessary to make good any arrears of Rent and any other damage, injury, expense or liability caused to Landlord by such event of default, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand the amount SO applied in order to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. Any remaining balance of the Security Deposit shall be returned by Landlord to Tenant within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the Term of this Lease.</p>

Tenant shall deposit with Landlord prepaid rent in the amount set forth in Paragraph (13) of the Data Sheet (the "Prepaid Rent") upon execution of this Lease to be applied to the first installment of Minimum Rent and Additional Rent due hereunder. If Tenant fails to remit such sum, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Tenant given prior to the delivery of the Prepaid Rent, and neither party shall have any further liability to the other.

Tenant further agrees to hold harmless Landlord and defend Landlord, its agents and employees against any and all claims of the employee and/or owner of the vehicle towed. Landlord may at any time close temporarily any portion of the Common Areas to make repairs or changes, to prevent the acquisition of public rights in the Common Areas and to discourage non-customer use, provided the same shall not materially adversely affect access to or visibility of the Premises. In addition, Landlord may modify, from time to time, the traffic flow pattern and layout of parking spaces and the entrances-exits to adjoining public streets or walkways, utilize portions of the Common Areas for entertainment, displays and charitable activities, and do such other acts in and to the Common Areas as in its judgment may be desirable to improve the convenience or attraction thereof. Tenant hereby specifically acknowledges the value of the "mixed-use" nature of the Shopping Center, and agrees that Landlord, in its sole discretion, shall have the right to use any part of the Common Areas to host and arrange special events, including, but not limited to art festivals or exhibitions, sporting events, music events and/or concerts, holiday events (including an ice skating rink), fireworks, athletic events, competitions and/or exhibitions, outdoor movies, food trucks and other culinary events, and any other events of a special nature.</p>

If (i) more than fifty percent (50%) of the square footage of the Premises shall be damaged by any fire or other casualty during the last three (3) years of the Term of this Lease (not including any option or renewal periods) or during any renewal or extension of the Term hereof, or (ii) Landlord is unable to rebuild any portion of the Building or of the Shopping Center due to any inability to obtain any required governmental approval in connection therewith, or (iii) more than fifty percent (50%) of the floor area of the Building or of the Shopping Center shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, or (iv) if all or any part of the Building or of the Shopping Center or the Premises shall be damaged or destroyed at any time by the occurrence of any risk not insured under the insurance required to be carried under Article IX above, or (v) for any reason whatsoever sufficient insurance proceeds are not available (including, without limitation, by the exercise of the right of any mortgagee of the Shopping Center to apply insurance proceeds to any obligations of Landlord to such mortgagee), then Landlord shall have the option to terminate this Lease by giving written notice to Tenant, and in the event of such termination, then neither party shall have any further liability to the other. Landlord shall give written notice to Tenant of such election within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such casualty and if it elects to rebuild and repair shall proceed to do so with reasonable diligence and at its sole cost and expense. Tenant hereby waives any and all rights that it may have to terminate this Lease by reason of damage to the Premises by fire or other casualty pursuant to any presently existing or hereafter enacted statute or pursuant to any other law.</p>

<p id="282"> (b) Landlord's obligation to rebuild and repair under this Article X shall in any event be limited to restoring Landlord's Work to substantially the same condition in which the same existed prior to the casualty. In no event shall Landlord be required to repair or replace Tenant's merchandise, trade fixtures, furnishings or equipment. Tenant agrees that promptly after completion of such work by Landlord Tenant shall proceed with reasonable diligence and at Tenant's sole cost and expense to restore, repair and replace all alterations, additions, improvements, fixtures, signs and equipment installed by Tenant as a part of Tenant's Work to substantially the same condition in which the same existed prior to the casualty, and restock the Premises with Tenant's inventory for operation of its business as required under Section 5.2, and promptly thereafter open for business to the public.</p>

<p id="283"> (c) Tenant agrees that during any period of reconstruction or repair of the Premises it shall continue the operation of its business within the Premises to the extent practicable. During the period from the occurrence of the casualty until Landlord's repairs are completed, the Minimum Rent shall be reduced to such</p>

If the parking facilities are reduced below the minimum parking requirements imposed by the applicable authorities, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease by giving Tenant notice within one hundred twenty (120) days after such taking. In the case of any taking or condemnation, whether or not the Term shall cease and terminate, the entire award shall be the property of Landlord; provided, however, Tenant shall be entitled to any award as may be made for trade fixtures and other equipment which under the terms of this Lease would not have become the property of Landlord; further provided, that any such award to Tenant shall not be in diminution of any award otherwise to be made to Landlord in the absence of such award to Tenant. In the event of termination of this Lease in accordance with this Section 11.1, neither party shall have any further obligation to the other.</p>

<p id="288"> Section 11.2. Rent Apportionment.

Any such attempted or purported transfer, assignment, mortgaging or encumbering of this Lease or any of Tenant's interest hereunder, and any attempted or purported subletting or grant of a right to use or occupy all or a portion of the Premises in violation of the foregoing sentence, whether voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law or otherwise, shall be null and void and shall not confer any rights upon any purported transferee, assignee, mortgagee or occupant and shall terminate this Lease without relieving Tenant of any of its obligations hereunder for the balance of the stated Term. Nothing contained elsewhere in this Lease shall authorize Tenant to enter into any franchise, concession, license, permit, subtenancy, departmental operation arrangements or the like, except pursuant to the provisions of this Article XII.

Landlord, after receiving such request, shall have a thirty (30) day period in which to provide written notice to Tenant informing Tenant that Landlord approves the transfer (with or without conditions), disapproves the transfer or will elect to recapture the Premises as provided for in Section 12.4 below. The consent by Landlord to any proposed assignment or sublease shall not release Tenant from any covenant or obligation under this Lease, nor be deemed a waiver or release of the non-assignability covenants in their future application, nor shall the collection or acceptance of rent from any such assignee, transferee, subtenant or occupant constitute a waiver of or a release of Tenant from any covenant or obligation contained in this Lease.</p>

All Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent and Additional Rent payable by Tenant hereunder shall be apportioned as of the Termination Date and Tenant shall promptly pay to Landlord any amounts so determined to be due and owing by Tenant to Landlord, and conversely Landlord shall promptly reimburse Tenant for any amounts prepaid by Tenant for periods subsequent to the Termination Date.

<p id="324"> (a) Landlord, in addition to other rights or remedies it may have, shall have the right, by written notice to Tenant, to declare this Lease terminated and the Term ended, in which event this Lease and the Term shall terminate with the same force and effect as though the date set forth in the notice of termination was the</p>

<p id="325"> date originally set forth herein and fixed for the expiration of the then-current Term, and Tenant shall immediately vacate and surrender the Premises in accordance with Section 18.1, but shall remain liable for all obligations arising during the balance of the then-current Term as if this Lease had remained in full force and effect. If Tenant fails to vacate the Premises, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in rent, enter upon and take possession of the Premises and expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying the Premises or any part thereof, without being liable for prosecution or any claim or damage therefor; and Landlord may recover from Tenant the following:</p>

<p id="327"> (ii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus</p>

<p id="330"> (v) At Landlord's election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by applicable law. The term "rent" as used in this Subsection 15.2(a) shall be deemed to be and to mean all sums of every nature required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease, whether to Landlord or to others. As used in Subsections 15.2(a)(i) and (ii) above, the "worth at the time of award" shall be computed by allowing interest at the rate specified in Section 21.12 hereof, but in no case greater than the maximum amount of such interest permitted by law. As used in Subsection 15.2(a)(iii) above, the "worth at the time of award" shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%).</p>

To the extent permitted by law, Tenant waives notice of re-entry or institution of legal proceedings to that end and any right of redemption, re-entry or repossession. No re-entry or commencement of any action for re-entry shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease, nor shall it absolve or release Tenant from any of its obligations for the remainder of the Term.

<p id="332"> (c) If Landlord re-enters, or takes possession pursuant to legal proceedings or otherwise, or if Tenant shall abandon, vacate or surrender the Premises before the expiration of the Term without having paid the full rental for the remainder of the Term, Landlord may either terminate this Lease or from time to time, without terminating this Lease, make such alterations and repairs as necessary in order to relet the Premises, and relet the Premises or any part thereof for such term or terms and for such rent and upon such other terms</p>

If such rentals and other sums received from such reletting during any month shall be less than the amount payable to Landlord by Tenant hereunder for the subject month, it being agreed that Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all costs and expenses of such reletting within thirty (30) days after Landlord's written request, Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord; if such rentals and other sums shall be more, Tenant shall have no right to, and shall receive no credit for, the excess. Such deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly. Notwithstanding any such reletting without termination, Landlord may at any time elect to terminate this Lease for such previous event of default.</p>

<p id="334"> (d) Should Landlord at any time terminate this Lease for any event of default, in addition to any other remedies it may have, it may recover from Tenant all damages it may incur by reason of such event of default, including the cost of recovering the Premises, reasonable attorneys' fees, and the worth at the time of such termination of the excess, if any, of the amount of rent and charges equivalent to rent reserved in this Lease for the remainder of the then-current Term over the then reasonable rental value of the Premises for the remainder of the then-current Term, all of which amounts shall be immediately due and payable from Tenant to Landlord. In determining the rent which would be payable by Tenant hereunder, subsequent to default, the annual Minimum Rent for each year of the unexpired Term shall be equal to the applicable annual Minimum Rent for such years as provided for in Section 3.1 plus an amount equal to the average annual Percentage Rent which Tenant was obligated to pay from the commencement of the Term to the time of default, or during the preceding three (3) full calendar years, whichever period is shorter. The failure or refusal of Landlord to relet the Premises shall not affect Tenant's liability.</p>

<p id="335"> (e) Any damage or loss of rent sustained by Landlord may be recovered by Landlord, at Landlord's option, at the time of the reletting or termination, in a single action or in separate actions from time to time as said loss of rents or damages shall accrue, or in a single proceeding deferred by Landlord or with jurisdiction reserved by the court until the expiration of the Term (in which event Tenant hereby agrees that, at Landlord's option, the cause of action shall not be deemed to have accrued until the date of expiration of the Term). In case suit shall be brought for recovery of the Premises, or for the recovery of rent or any other amount due under the provisions of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord all expenses incurred therefor, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

<p id="336"> (f) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the enforcement of any claim Landlord may have against Tenant for anticipatory breach of the unexpired Term. In the event of an anticipatory breach by Tenant of any of the covenants or provisions hereof or in the event of Tenant's default, Landlord shall have the right of injunction and the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity as if re-entry, summary proceedings and other remedies were not provided for herein. Mention in this Lease of any particular remedy shall not preclude Landlord from any other remedy, in law or in equity. Tenant hereby expressly waives for itself and all persons claiming by or through Tenant, any and all rights to redeem, reinstate, restore, or obtain relief from forfeiture of this Lease granted by or under any present or future law in the event of Tenant being evicted or dispossessed for any cause, or in the event of Landlord obtaining possession of the Premises by reason of the violation by Tenant of any of the covenants and conditions of this Lease.</p>

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, in the event that Landlord or Tenant shall be delayed or hindered in or prevented from the performance of any act (other than Tenant's obligation to make payments of Minimum Rent, Additional Rent, and other charges required hereunder), by reason of strikes, lockouts, unavailability of materials, weather, failure of power, restrictive governmental laws or regulations, riots, insurrections, the act, failure to act, or default of the other party, war or other reason beyond its control, then performance of such act shall be excused for the period of the delay and the period for the performance of such act shall be extended for a period equivalent to the period of such delay.

<p id="440"> 8. If Tenant undertakes any construction activities which cause any work stoppage, picketing, labor disruption or dispute, so as to interfere with activities at the Shopping Center, Tenant shall, upon request from Landlord, immediately suspend any construction work being performed in the Premises giving rise to such labor problems. Tenant shall have no claim for damages of any nature against Landlord for such suspension nor shall the Commencement Date be extended as a result thereof.</p>

<p id="503"> THIS GUARANTY OF LEASE (this "Guaranty") is made as of the day of 2017, by TRUYEN H. NGUYEN, an individual ("Guarantor"), to and for the benefit of DURBIN PARK PAVILION, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Landlord").</p>

<p id="504"> RECITALS</p>

<p id="505"> Landlord, as landlord, and LE NAILS & SPA, INC., a Florida corporation ("Tenant"), as tenant, have entered into, or are about to enter into, a certain Shopping Center Lease dated of even date herewith, pursuant to which Tenant leases or will lease from Landlord certain premises in the shopping center to be known as The Pavilion at Durbin Park and located in the City of St. John's, St. John's County, Florida, all as more particularly described in said Lease. Said Lease, as heretofore or hereafter supplemented, amended, restated, renewed, extended, replaced or modified, is hereinafter referred to as the "Lease". All capitalized terms that are not expressly defined in this Guaranty shall have the same meanings herein as are ascribed to such terms in the Lease.</p>

<p id="506"> A. Landlord has required, as a condition to its execution and performance of the Lease, that Guarantor execute and deliver this Guaranty of all obligations of Tenant arising and all sums due by Tenant under the Lease. The execution and delivery of this Guaranty by Guarantor is a material inducement to Landlord for the execution and performance of the Lease.</p>

<p id="507"> B. Guarantor has a financial interest in Tenant and will be benefited by the Lease. Accordingly, Guarantor has agreed to execute, deliver and perform this Guaranty.</p>

<p id="508"> NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recitals set forth above and in consideration of Landlord executing and performing its obligations under the Lease and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, adequacy and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Guarantor covenants and agrees as follows:</p>

<p id="509"> 1. Recitals. The Recitals set forth above are incorporated herein and shall be deemed terms and provisions hereof.</p>

<p id="510"> 2. Guaranty. For the term of the Lease, Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Landlord:</p>

<p id="511"> (a) The full and prompt payment when due, whether upon acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all rentals, debts and obligations of Tenant for the payment of money, however created, arising or evidenced, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter existing, due or to become due, known or unknown to Guarantor at the time of the execution of this Guaranty, including, without limitation, all Rent, late fees, payments in respect of real estate taxes, assessments, governmental charges, premiums for insurance policies, amounts required to discharge mechanics' and materialmen's liens and claims therefor, and any other sums which may now be or hereafter become due by Tenant under the Lease;</p>

<p id="512"> (b) The payment of all Enforcement Costs (as hereinafter defined); and</p>

<p id="513"> (c) The full, complete and punctual observance, performance and satisfaction of all covenants, terms, conditions, obligations, duties and agreements of Tenant under the Lease.</p>

<HR pn=55>


<p id="514"> All amounts due and debts, liabilities and payment obligations described in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph 2 are referred to herein as the "Liabilities." All obligations described in subparagraph (c) of this Paragraph 2 are referred to herein as the "Obligations." Guarantor shall be required, during the term of this Guaranty, to maintain a net worth value of no less than its net worth as presented to Landlord as of the date of execution of this Lease (the "Guarantor Net Worth").</p>

<p id="515"> 3. Landlord's Remedies.</p>

<p id="516"> (a) This Guaranty is an absolute, irrevocable, present and continuing guaranty of payment and performance and not merely a guaranty of collection. In the event of any default by Tenant under the Lease or under any other obligation to Landlord, after the expiration of any cure period applicable thereto, Guarantor agrees, on demand by Landlord, to pay all Liabilities then due hereunder. In the event that there shall be any default by Tenant, Guarantor or any other party under the Lease in the due and timely performance and observance of the Obligations or any of them after the expiration of any cure period applicable thereto, then, in such event, Guarantor agrees, on demand by Landlord: (i) to perform the Obligations; and (ii) to indemnify and hold Landlord and the other Indemnified Parties (hereinafter defined) harmless from and against any and all loss, damage, cost, expense, injury or liability Landlord or the Indemnified Parties may suffer or incur in connection with the exercise of the rights under the Lease, this Guaranty or otherwise in respect of the Premises. If Guarantor fails to commence and pursue diligently the performance of the Obligations after the expiration of any cure period applicable thereto as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and if such failure continues for five (5) days after receipt by Guarantor of written notice from Landlord demanding the performance of Guarantor, then, either before or after pursuing any other remedy of Landlord against Guarantor or Tenant and regardless of whether Landlord shall ever pursue any such other remedy, Landlord shall have the right (but not the obligation) to perform the Obligations or to call upon any other reputable parties to perform the Obligations, and shall have the right to expend such sums as Landlord in its reasonable discretion deems proper in order SO to complete the performance of the Obligations. During the course of the performance of any Obligations undertaken by Landlord or by any other party on behalf of Landlord, Guarantor shall pay on demand any amounts due to third parties in connection therewith. All amounts required to be paid by the terms hereof shall be included within the term "Liabilities," and all obligations required to be performed by the terms hereof shall be included within the term "Obligations."</p>

<p id="517"> (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, in any action to enforce any of the liabilities or obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty, Landlord, at its election, may proceed against Guarantor with or without: (i) joining Tenant in any such action; (ii) commencing any action against or obtaining any judgment against Tenant; or (iii) commencing any proceeding to enforce or realize upon any collateral or other security (including, without limitation, any security deposit or other guaranties) which may be given to secure Tenant's obligations under the Lease, or to obtain any judgment, decree or foreclosure sale with respect thereto. Nevertheless, the maintenance of any action or proceeding by Landlord to recover any sum or sums that may be or become due under the Lease or to secure the performance of any of the other terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease shall not preclude Landlord from demanding and receiving the payment of such sums and the performance of such other terms, covenants and conditions from Guarantor, or from thereafter instituting and maintaining subsequent actions or proceedings for any subsequent default or defaults of Tenant under the Lease.
